# MP3 EDITOR üéß

* The MP3 Editor is a web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Specifically Node.js and jQuery) that acts as an interface to add metadata to your mp3 files. It can attempt to automatically tag a file for you, or you can enter the information yourself if you choose. The design is heavily referenced on Google's Material Design, but comes with its own twist. _Still confused on what it does? [Read more here](https://mp3-editor.glitch.me/about)._
* I do not support this way of pirating music, I urge anyone reading to purchase music to support artists instead of doing it this way. This is just an experiment I used to teach myself about backend/frontend relations in javascript

_Please note that this code is very ugly and not practical and was an experiment to teach myself. The code is not at all good._
